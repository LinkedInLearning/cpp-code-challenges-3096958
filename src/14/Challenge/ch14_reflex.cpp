// Challenge #14: The Reflex Game
// Write an application that waits a random delay between 4 and 10 seconds, and then asks the user to type in a random word.
// This random word comes from a list of 10 3-letter words.
// If the user enters the correct word in less than 2 seconds, print a success message on the screen.
// Otherwise, print a failure message.
// Ignore the case ("CAT" = "cat" = "CaT").

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <chrono>
#include <algorithm>

// The Reflex Game, main()
// Summary: This application measures the time it takes a user to type in a random 3-letter word.
